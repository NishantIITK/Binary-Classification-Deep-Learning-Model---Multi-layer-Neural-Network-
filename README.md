Neural network concepts are inspired by how our brain works. We can visualize an NN as a collection of connected nodes. These nodes are connected by weights, which are the parameters that transform input data within the network's hidden layers. Activation function defines how the weighted sum of the input nodes is transformed to the next layer. Neural networks are very useful tools in performing a wide range of machine learning tasks.

For the given task, I have made an NN model for implementing binary classification of data.
